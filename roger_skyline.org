* V.2 VM Part
** Hypervisor
- Hyper-V (Microsoft)
- to setup "turn Windows features on and off" ...
** Linux OS
- CentOS 7 (RHEL 7 community clone)
- downloaded via torrent from centos.org
- installation via graphic installer (basic server + system administration tools)
- check version: =cat /etc/centos-release=
** Disk size
- you choose size in the process of creating VM in Hyper-V - you just type an integer in the corresponding field; BUT for some reason when you choose "8 GB" Windows creates a slightly larger disk
- check: =lsblk -b=
** Partitions
- partitions were created during the installation process
- they can be triffled with via =fdisk= or =parted= utility (=gparted= in GUI)
- check: =parted -l= or =lsblk -b=
** Packages
- CentOS uses =yum= as a package manager which behaves just like apt but has nicer UI
- packages can be updated via =yum update= and upgraded via =yum upgrade=
- you can list all installed packages using =yum list installed=
* V.3 Network and Security Part
** Non-root user
- non-root user "ak" was created during the installation process
- you can create new users via =useradd= (use =-m= flag to also create standard folders in new user's home directory)
- check: =cat /etc/passwd= or =getent passwd=
** Special rights for the user
- in order to allow user to execute commands with root priveleges he must be appended to the group with such rights ("root", "wheel", "adm")
- you can add user to the group via =usermod -aG= (=-a= for append)
- to make sure group has root access rights use =visudo= and uncomment certain lines if necessary
- check: =id= or =groups=
** Static IP with netmask 30
- you can query existing interfaces and their ips via =ifconfig= or =ip a s=
- per-interface settings are stored at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<...>
- a better way to interact with your network settings is though is via =nmtui= utility
